# Processing-workplace
This repo contains all the processing sketches I'm playing around with. Mostly Coding Challenges from the Coding Train youtube channel, but also
some stuff that I've added myself. 

Sometimes I continue on with the examples from those videos, sometimes I have small gimmicky play things that are not worth their own repo.
Basically, this is my __Processing__ playground.
